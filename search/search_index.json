EPEL provides rebuilds of Fedora packages for every supported enterprise linux. Packages in this repository do not replace the base. You can install EPEL by running <code>dnf install epel-release</code> and the package will be installed from the extras repository. The package will automatically have EPEL enabled. Support for EPEL can be found in <code>#epel</code> on Libera. Community Enterprise Linux Repository (ELRepo) - ELRepo focuses on newer kernels and kmod driver packages to enhance hardware support for currently supported Enterprise Linux versions. This includes display, filesystem, network, storage drivers. You can install the necessary repo files by running <code>dnf install elrepo-release</code>. Note that the kernel repositories will have to be enabled. RPM Fusion - RPM Fusion provides software that the Fedora Project or Red Hat does not want to ship in Enterprise Linux and Fedora. These repositories do rely on EPEL. The policy is to not replace EPEL nor base packages. The free repository can be installed by running <code>dnf install rpmfusion-free-release</code>. Remi Repository - Remi maintains a large collection of RPMs, including latest versions of PHP, among other things. His FAQ can be found here. This is a collection of repositories. Using the <code>-safe</code> series of repositories will ensure that nothing from the base will be replaced or overwritten. However, be aware that these repositories do not play well with other third party repositories. You will need to use caution as you enable more repositories on your system. GhettoForge - GhettoForge provides packages not in other third party repositories. Packages that overwrite the base would be in the <code>gf-plus</code> repository. Please see usage for more information. Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) - TDE provides Enterprise Linux packages for a KDE 3.5 style desktop environment. As of this writing, EL8 and EL9 repositories exist. You can find TDE support resources here. ZFS On Linux - The ZFS on Linux project is an implementation of OpenZFS, designed to work in a Linux environment. While this filesystem is very popular, it receives no testing or support from Rocky Release Engineering or Testing. Use at your own risk. Upstream centos-release-* - In the extras repository, there are <code>centos-release-*</code> packages that provide additional repositories from the Special Interest Groups of CentOS.

Louis celebrated that, \u201cThe real win of the South East Linux Fest isn't that all of us were here... it's that we A) solved two package build issues and B) solved MTU problems, with Skip, Neil, Pablo, and Taylor all in person at the booth with some folks witnessing it in person.\u201d</p> <p>Various posts about the event from our socials and individual team members:</p> <p>Traveling to the event</p> <p>Arrived!</p> <p>Neil and Fred</p> <p>Sunday morning Facebook</p> <p>General post on Mastodon</p> <p>One of the questions we heard a lot this weekend was, \u201cWhat makes Rocky Linux stand out?\u201d As a bug-for-bug compatible RHEL clone, in some ways it\u2019s just a matter of preference. One strength of open source is in its diverse solutions. </p> <p>But on the other hand, we think this community is something special. We formed around the shared purpose of providing and maintaining a stable Enterprise Linux solution with a commitment to keeping the promise of a ten-year release cycle, in a way that ensures control of it can never be taken from the community by a single person or corporation. And we\u2019ve kept going through the shared value of collaboration, and staying focused on the goal.</p> <p>In two and a half years we have encountered tricky problems, and shed a little blood, sweat, and tears together to find solutions. We have weathered setbacks and come back stronger each time. We\u2019ve learned from each other, pushed each other to be better, and developed enduring friendships with people around the globe.</p> <p>As everyone headed home (or for some of us, onward to another event) at the end, the messages poured into the chat channel. </p> <p>From the airport Pablo sent, \u201cReally amazing to have been there, already at the airport waiting to go back. Hopefully we'll see each other gain soon.\u201d</p> <p>Neil reflected, \u201cso glad to have gotten us all together. I'm excited - our project is feeling so much more \"real\" now that so many of us have met in person. love y'all  and safe travels.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile when Skip got home he sent this message, \u201cSkip Grube has marked himself safe from the North Carolina freeway.\u201d</p> <p>Louis chimed in, \u201cLanded safely. Till we all meet again\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The Rocky Linux community intends to be around for the long haul, which means, relatively, we are still just getting started. There\u2019s still lots of room for more people to get involved! Whether you are a developer, a security expert, a graphic designer, or a technical writer; whether you\u2019re a seasoned genius or an enthusiastic baby beginner; whether your interest is in Rocky Linux itself or in how you can use it to pursue your own special interest project: we\u2019d love to meet you.</p> <p>You can meet Rocky community members in several channels, listed in the \u201ccommunity\u201d tab at RockyLinux.org. And maybe one of these days, we\u2019ll meet up with you at a conference, too!</p>"},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/24FOSDEM/","title":"FOSDEM 2024 with CentOS Connect","text":""},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/24FOSDEM/#submitted-by-krista-burdine","title":"Submitted by Krista Burdine","text":""},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/24FOSDEM/#fringe-event-details","title":"Fringe Event Details:","text":"<ul> <li>CentOS Connect: February 1-2, 2024</li> <li>Location: Radisson Hotel, Grand Place Brussels</li> <li>Type: Sponsor, Release Engineering mastermind </li> </ul>"},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/24FOSDEM/#main-event-details","title":"Main Event Details:","text":"<ul> <li>FOSDEM: February 3-4, 2024</li> <li>Location: ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium</li> <li>Type: Stand sponsor, Enterprise Linux hallway</li> </ul>"},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/24FOSDEM/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":"<p>First, this event included the CentOS Connect fringe event, which we sponsored.

This meetup offers a platform for the Peridot developers and release engineering teams, as well as other interested parties to come together to analyze, plan, organize, and pave the way for a more efficient and streamlined release process for the core Operating System and SIGs. All are welcome to join this conversation regardless of your familiarity with Peridot or the Rocky Linux project! 2 Warewulf: an overview, new features, and community updates Saturday, 3 February 14:10 - 14:20 UA2.118 Brian Phan Warewulf is a simple, lightweight, stateless cluster provisioning tool. This talk will cover a high-level overview of Warewulf and its features. It will also provide a sneak peak into features coming in version 4.5 such as grub netboot and disk provisioning with Ignition. Finally, we will provide some organizational updates within the project such as formalization of community engagement, establishment of a technical steering group, and how you can get involved in the project today. 3 Updates and Innovations with the Apptainer Platform Saturday, 3 February 14:45 - 14:55 UA2.118 Forrest Burt Apptainer, an open-source containerization software built for HPC and used by over 25,000 computing sites worldwide, entered the Linux Foundation about two years ago. This was accompanied by a rebasing in version and a fresh roadmap of features for the software project moving forward. A significant amount of development has happened both on these features and on methods of utilizing Apptainer itself for greater efficiency in HPC since this changeover. This talk will explain these developments, including new support for fully rootless builds and installs of Apptainer, ways Apptainer now leverages the Linux user namespace for some of its features, innovations in using Apptainers with MPI and fabric adaptors, and the usefulness of ORAS protocol in software supply chain management and its current state of integration with OCI registries."},{"location":"team/community/event-reports/FOSDEM_2024/#goals-messaging","title":"Goals &amp; Messaging","text":"<p>Stub, fill in - mostly around SIGs and supporting the community in a variety of facets.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/","title":"Design Team","text":""},{"location":"team/design/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>The Design team handles Rocky Linux branding and design.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/#management","title":"Management","text":"<p>This team is lead by Michael Kinder.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/#contact","title":"Contact","text":""},{"location":"team/design/#email","title":"Email","text":"<p>design@rockylinux.org</p>"},{"location":"team/design/#mattermost","title":"Mattermost","text":"<p>Design</p>"},{"location":"team/design/#members","title":"Members","text":"Role Name Email Mattermost Name IRC Name Design Team Lead Michael Kinder mkinder@rockylinux.org @ressonix ressonix"},{"location":"team/design/#join-team","title":"Join Team","text":"<p>If you are interested in joining the Design Team as a Deputy, we ask that you start making contributions, engaging with the lead in the Mattermost channel, and engaging with the community.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/branding/","title":"Branding","text":""},{"location":"team/design/branding/#brand-kit","title":"Brand Kit","text":"<p>Download</p> <p>Please refer to the included Brand &amp; Trademark Usage Guide to ensure that you follow our brand and trademark policies.

This policy attempts to strike the proper balance between two competing interests: 1) the need of the RESF to ensure that its trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they have been created to preserve and 2) the need of RESF to ensure that community members are able to discuss the projects with which RESF is associated and to accurately describe the relationship between RESF and the products and services offered by others.</p> <p>A trademark provides the owner with an exclusive right to authorize or control the use of the mark. Your right to use a mark of RESF is provided for in this policy and in the statement of permitted use, if any, that may accompany the trademark notice displayed on the website dedicated to the project. A copyright license, even an open source copyright license, does not include an implied right or license to use a trademark that may be related to the project developing the licensed software or other materials. Because open source licenses permit unrestricted modification of the copyrighted software, and RESF has no intention of interfering with that right, your right to use any specific trademark of RESF is not determined by your use of software made available under an open source license. Your right to use a mark is conditioned upon conforming to other requirements that are directly related to the qualities that the specific mark has been created to preserve.</p> <p>Proper use of RESF trademarks by following these trademark guidelines protects the value of RESF trademarks. Any use of or reference to RESF trademarks that is inconsistent with this trademark policy, or use of marks that are confusingly similar to trademarks of RESF, is prohibited. All uses of RESF trademarks, and all goodwill associated therewith, will inure solely to the benefit of RESF.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/branding/#rules-that-apply-to-trademarks-in-general","title":"Rules That Apply to Trademarks in General","text":"<p>There are some basic rules that apply to any use of any trade or service mark that you do not own, including any mark of RESF, without the express permission of the owner.</p> <ul> <li>A trademark should never be used as a verb or a noun. A trademark should be used only as an adjective followed by the generic name/noun.</li> <li>A trademark should not be used in the plural or possessive form.</li> <li>A trademark should not be altered or amended in any way. A mark should not be combined with any other mark, hyphenated, abbreviated or displayed in parts. A trademark that is depicted as two or more words should not be compressed into one word. A logo should not be displayed with color variations, or with other elements superimposed on top of the logo.</li> <li>A trademark should not be used as your domain name or as part of your domain name.</li> <li>A trademark should not be incorporated into your company\u2019s logos or designs.</li> <li>A trademark notice should be used on the most prominent and/or first appearance of each mark of RESF, and a trademark notice should not be changed. In particular, a \u2122 should not be changed to a \u00ae in a trademark notice by anyone other than the owner. Alternatively, or as a supplement to the \u00ae, \u2122, or common law notices, a footnote or text notice with one of the alternative statutory notices is good practice: \u201cX is a trademark of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation.\u201d If you are unsure about whether a mark of RESF is registered in your country, please contact us for additional guidance as to what trademark symbol you should use.</li> </ul> <p>There are also some basic rights that everyone has to use any trademark, which are often referred to as \"fair use,\" and RESF does not intend to restrict those rights. You may make fair use of word marks to make true factual statements. But fair use does not permit you to state or imply that the owner of a mark products, endorses, or supports your company, products, or services. Even when making fair use of a trademark, you should acknowledge the owner of the trademark with a trademark notice, such as the notice displayed on RESF project websites.</p>"},{"location":"team/design/branding/#rules-and-policies-applicable-to-marks-owned-by-resf","title":"Rules and Policies Applicable to Marks Owned by RESF","text":"<p>In addition to the generally applicable rules discussed above, there are a few specific rules that we ask everyone to follow when using trademarks owned by RESF.</p> <ul> <li>Use the full form of any trademark (e.g., \u201cRocky Enterprise Software Foundation\u201d) in the first reference in all documents of mass communication, including marketing collateral and web pages. You may then use any abbreviated or short form references (e.g. \u201cRESF\u201d) within the same document where the full form has already been used.</li> <li>Use RESF\u2019s trademarks in a form that distinguishes them from the text around them, such as by capitalization, bold or italic fonts, or with quotation marks. Any use of unregistered trademarks as listed in the Trademark List above should include a \u2122 immediately after the first usage (e.g., \u201cThe Rocky Linux\u2122 community seeks to secure\u2026\u201d)</li> <li>Do not use RESF trademarks in a manner that would disparage RESF or its projects (e.g., untruthful advertising, false/misleading promotional materials, etc.).</li> <li>Do not use a RESF logo on the cover of a book or magazine without written permission from RESF.</li> <li>Do not use a logo of RESF on posters, brochures, signs, websites, or other marketing materials to promote your events, products or services without written permission from RESF.</li> <li>Do not refer to a product or service as being certified under any of RESF\u2019s marks unless your company has successfully undergone the requisite compliance testing and has explicit authorization to use such terms from RESF.</li> <li>Do not attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in any mark of RESF and do not attempt to register any RESF trademark as a trademark, trade name, domain name, or \u201cdoing business as\u201d name, alone or (unless specifically licensed) in combination with your own trademarks.</li> <li>Do not use any RESF trademark in metatags, search fields, hidden text, or any other form that has the purpose or effect of diverting or confusing consumers without RESF\u2019s prior written permission.</li> <li>Do not adopt marks or logos that are confusingly similar to any RESF trademarks.</li> <li>Do not use RESF trademarks for products or services for which they were not originally intended.</li> <li>Do not alter a RESF trademark in any way.</li> </ul> <p>RESF marks have been created and their use is expressly permitted for a specific purpose. Do not use logos or names of RESF in any commercial or marketing context other than as expressly permitted in this policy unless you have obtained explicit written permission from RESF to do so. RESF permits the use of its trademarks for private and personal use to make t-shirts, stickers, and caps for yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don't receive anything of value in return) in a manner that is consistent with the preservation of the goodwill and value of the mark. The goodwill, if any, derived from your use of any RESF trademarks exclusively inures to the benefit of and belongs to the RESF.</p> <p>You are also allowed to use a trademark or logo of RESF as a link to the home page of the applicable project or to a web page on the RESF web site that is relevant to the reference so long as the link is in a manner that is consistent with the preservation of the goodwill and value of the mark. The link and all other usage of a logo of RESF shall be done using the official versions of RESF logos obtained from RESF or its projects.</p> <p>For examples of incorrect uses of a logo of RESF, please refer to Section 1.3 (Logo Misuse) of our Brand &amp; Trademark Usage Guide (included in our Brand Kit).</p> <p>Certain marks of RESF have been created to enable you to communicate compatibility or interoperability of software or products. In addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make an assertion of compatibility must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must avoid confusion regarding RESF's association with the product. The use of the mark cannot imply that RESF or its projects are sponsoring or endorsing the product. The following are examples of proper and improper usage of these trademarks of RESF:</p> <pre><code>Correct: &lt;your product name&gt; for &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;your product/company name&gt; plug-in for &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;your product name&gt; compatible with &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;your product name&gt; for use with &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: Quick Start for &lt;RESF mark&gt; by &lt;your company name&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;non-trademarked industry term&gt; Day featuring &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;non-trademarked industry term&gt; Day with &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nCorrect: &lt;non-trademarked industry term&gt; Day including &lt;RESF mark&gt;\n\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; &lt;your product name&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; by &lt;your company name&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; - &lt;your product name&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;your product/company name&gt; - &lt;RESF mark&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; Quick Start by &lt;your company name&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; Day\nIncorrect: &lt;RESF mark&gt; Day by &lt;your company name&gt;\nIncorrect: &lt;non-trademarked industry term&gt; Day brought to you by &lt;RESF mark&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"team/design/branding/#questions-comments-concerns","title":"Questions, Comments, Concerns","text":"<p>We look to our community to help us retain the value of RESF's trade and service marks.
