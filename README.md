# Rocky Linux wiki

This is the Rocky Linux wiki, built using zensical.

If you wish to propose changes, please fork this repo and PR against the
development branch. If you are PR'ing against main, you will be asked to
switch to the development branch.

## Notes

Zensical is missing some features, so not all mkdocs functionality will
work. Ensure that you properly test with `zensical serve`.
