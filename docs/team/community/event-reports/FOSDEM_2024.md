## Hotel

Most of the Rocky folks attending are staying in the [Marriot Renaissance Brussels Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/brubr-renaissance-brussels-hotel/), or the Marriot Executive Apartments, which are directly next door.

This hotel is roughly half way between the Grand Place (city center) and the ULB campus, where the CentOS Connect and FOSDEM events are being held, respectively.

As we're all staying in the same place, we can travel in groups as needed.

This talk will cover a high-level overview of Warewulf and its features. It will also provide a sneak peak into features coming in version 4.5 such as grub netboot and disk provisioning with Ignition. Finally, we will provide some organizational updates within the project such as formalization of community engagement, establishment of a technical steering group, and how you can get involved in the project today.|

This was accompanied by a rebasing in version and a fresh roadmap of features for the software project moving forward. A significant amount of development has happened both on these features and on methods of utilizing Apptainer itself for greater efficiency in HPC since this changeover. This talk will explain these developments, including new support for fully rootless builds and installs of Apptainer, ways Apptainer now leverages the Linux user namespace for some of its features, innovations in using Apptainers with MPI and fabric adaptors, and the usefulness of ORAS protocol in software supply chain management and its current state of integration with OCI registries.|
