# All Things Open 2024

## Event Details
- **Date:** October 28-30, 2024
- **Location:** Raleigh, NC, USA
- **Type:** Attendee, Speaker

## Overview
As declared on the event home page, “More than anything, ATO is an educational conference where attendees learn about new technologies and topics, and it’s always been that way. The goal is for attendees to leave having learned something or been made aware of something new.”

## Highlights
- Community Leadership Summit -  This colocated event, hosted one day before the main conference, was run as an “Unconference,” meaning that moderated and facilitated discussions were featured to deliver a rich set of content driven by a diverse audience. Topics were proposed and chosen onsite by attendees, including a discussion facilitated by Rocky Linux Community leader Krista Burdine, in the contextual setting of the heightened political season, about dealing with internal and ecosystem politics in your open source project. #cls2024
- Diversity and Inclusion Summit - This co-located event, also hosted one day before the main conference, featured traditional talks, panel discussions, and attendee Q&A about relevant topics. This event featured subject matter experts as well as community and company leaders.
- The Open Source Initiative (OSI), which has been working all year on a definition of AI, for the purpose of protecting open source access to LLM technology, released its official [definition](https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition) during one of the sessions. The community, which cares passionately about this subject, has varied perspectives on the nuances of this question, and reactions to the resulting definition were deeply divided. Change always brings some combination of progress and pushback; it will be interesting to see the long-term outcome of this situation. 
- Earlier in October, All Things Open announced itself as the successor to the opensource.com education and support community formerly supported by Red Hat, and this conference served as its official launch under the tagline “We Love Open Source.” Going forward, look to [this community](https://allthingsopen.org/) for thought leadership and idea development, through blogs, articles, videos, and podcasts by familiar and new names, in areas relevant to *all things open* source.

## Outcome
- This was promised as a good networking event, and it did not disappoint. From the Community Leadership Summit to the speaker/sponsor dinner, from sending a speaker for this high quality event to getting the chance to interact with reps from many of our sponsors and partners including CIQ, arm, Equinix, Google Cloud, and OpenLogic by Perforce, this event really felt like the hub of the equivalent of “The Room Where it Happens” in terms of open source community and innovation. As a significant open source project, Rocky Linux should make a priority of sponsoring and sending representatives, especially community leaders, to this event annually. If nothing else, this is an essential location to be part of the greater conversations surrounding open source.
