## General Information

When you request a PDR Delete Request, please note that the following will occur during processing:

* Your personal data and information will be removed from your account
* You will be removed from all relevant groups in [Account Services](https://accounts.rockylinux.org)
* Your account will be set to `private` in [Account Services](https://accounts.rockylinux.org)
* Your account in [Account Services](https://accounts.rockylinux.org) will be disabled

If your intention is to keep your account active and hide your personal information, you may set your profile to "private" in Account Services by:

1. Click `Edit Profile`
2. Select the checkbox for `Private`
3. Save.

## Mattermost Accounts

While we are working to integrate Mattermost with Rocky Account Services, at this time, Mattermost accounts are still separate and are not included in a typical PDR Delete Request. If you wish to have your Mattermost account removed, you may follow the instructions below and indicate which account you would like to be removed. If submitting via email, please send from the address associated with the account you wish to have removed. If a different email address is used, the request will need to be validated with the account's proper address prior to actioning the request. For security reasons, we are not able to reveal the email address associated with any account name.
