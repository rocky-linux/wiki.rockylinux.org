title: Local Module Builds
ignore_macros: true # prevent mkdocs-macros from barfing on the jinja in this page

Within the Fedora and Red Hat ecosystem, modularity is unfortunately a piece
that is a blessing and a curse. It might be more one way or the other.

This page is primarily to talk about how to do local builds for modules,
including the final formatting of the module yaml description that will have to
be imported into the repo via `modifyrepo_c`.

Note that the below is based on how `lazybuilder` performs module builds, which
was made to be close to MBS+Koji and is not perfect. This is mostly used as a
reference.

## Building Local Modules

This section explains what it's like to build local modules, what you can do,
and what you can expect.

### Module Source, "transmodrification", pulling sources

The module source typically lives in a `SOURCES` directory in a module git repo
with the name of `modulemd.src.txt`. This is a basic version that could be used
to do a module build. Each package listed is a reference to the stream version
for that particular module.

```
document: modulemd
version: 2
data:
  stream: 1.4
  summary: 389 Directory Server (base)
  description: >-
    389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server.  The base package includes
    the LDAP server and command line utilities for server administration.
  license:
    module:
    - MIT
  dependencies:
  - buildrequires:
      nodejs: [10]
      platform: [el8]
    requires:
      platform: [el8]
  filter:
    rpms:
    - cockpit-389-ds
  components:
    rpms:
      389-ds-base:
        rationale: Package in api
        ref: stream-1.4-rhel-8.4.0
        arches: [aarch64, ppc64le, s390x, x86_64]
```

Notice `ref`? That's the reference point. When a "transmodrification" occurs,
the process is supposed to look at each RPM repo in the components['rpms']
list. The branch name that this module data lives in will be the basis of how
it determines what the *new* references will be. In this example, the branch
name is `r8-stream-1.4` so when we do the "conversion", it should become
a git commit hash of the last commit in the branch `r8-stream-1.4` for that
particular rpm component.

```
document: modulemd
version: 2
data:
  stream: "1.4"
  summary: 389 Directory Server (base)
  description: 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server.  The base package
    includes the LDAP server and command line utilities for server administration.
  license:
    module:
    - MIT
  dependencies:
  - buildrequires:
      nodejs:
      - "10"
      platform:
      - el8
    requires:
      platform:
      - el8
  filter:
    rpms:
    - cockpit-389-ds
  components:
    rpms:
      389-ds-base:
        rationale: Package in api
        ref: efe94eb32d597765f49b7b1528ba9881e1f29327
        arches:
        - aarch64
        - ppc64le
        - s390x
        - x86_64
```

See the reference now? It's now a commit hash that refers directly to 389-ds-base
on branch `r8-stream-1.4`, being the last commit/tag. See the glossary at the
end of this page for more information, as it can be a commit hash, branch, or
tag name.

### Configuring Macros and Contexts

Traditionally within an MBS and Koji system, there are several macros that
are created and are usually unique per module stream. There are certain
components that work together to create a unique `%dist` tag based on several
factors. To summarize, here's what generally happens:

* **A module version is formed as** `M0m00YYYYMMDDhhmmss`**, which would be the major version, 0, minor version, 0, and then a timestamp.**
* **Select components are brought together and a sha1 hash is made, shortened to 8 characters for the context**

    * The runtime context is typically the "dependencies" section of the module source, calculated to sha1
    * The build context is the `xmd['mbs']['buildrequires']` data that koji generates and is output into `module.txt`, calculated to sha1
    * The runtime and build contexts are combined `BUILD:RUNTIME`, a sha1 is calculated, and then shortened to 8
    * This context is typically the one that changes less often

* **Select components are brought together and a sha1 hash is made, shortened to 8 characters for the dist tag**

    * The module name, stream, version, and context are all brought together as `name.stream.version.context`, calculated to sha1

* **The `%dist` tag is given a format of** `.module+elX.Y.Z+000+00000000` (note: fedora uses `.module_fcXX+000+00000000`)

    * X is the major version, Y is the minor version, Z is typically 0.
    * The second number is the iteration, aka the module number. If you've done 500 module builds, the next one would be 501, regardless of module.
    * The last set is a context hash generated earlier in the step above

#### Configuring the Macros

In koji+MBS, a module macros package is made that defines the module macros.
In lazybuilder, we skip that and define the macros directly. For example, in
mock, we drop a file with all the macros we need. Here's an example of 389-ds.
The file name is is `macros.zz-modules` to ensure these macros are picked up
last and will have precendence and override macros of similar names, especially
the `%dist` tag.

```
rpmbuild# cat /etc/rpm/macros.zz-modules

%dist .module_el8.4.0+636+837ee950
%modularitylabel 389-ds:1.4:8040020210810203142:866effaa
%_module_build 1
%_module_name 389-ds
%_module_stream 1.4
%_module_version 8040020210810203142
%_module_context 866effaa
```

The the `%dist` tag honestly is the most important piece here. But all of
these tags are required regardless.

##### Build Opts Macros

Some modules may have additional buildopts macros. Perl is a *great* example
of this. When koji+MBS make their module macros package for the build, they
combine the module macros and the build opts macros together into one file.
It will be the same exact file name each time.

```
rpmbuild# cat /etc/rpm/macros.zz-modules

# Module macros
%dist .module+el8.4.0+463+10533ad3
%modularitylabel perl:5.24:8040020210602173155:162f5753

#### Built Module Example

Let's break down an example of `389-ds` - It's a simple module. Let's start
with `modulemd.txt`, generated during a module build and before packages are
built. Notice how it has `xmd` data. That is an integral part
of making the context, though it's mostly information for koji and MBS and
is generated on the fly and used throughout the build process for each
arch. In the context of lazybuilder, it creates fake data to essentially
fill the gap of not having MBS+Koji in the first place. The comments will
point out what's used to make the contexts.

Below is a version meant to be imported into a repo. This is after the build's
completion. You'll notice that some fields are either empty or missing from
above or even from the git repo's source that we pulled from initially. You'll
also notice that xmd is now an empty dictionary. This is on purpose. While it
is optional in the repo module data, the build system typically gives it `{}`.

```

The final "repo" of modules (per arch) is eventually made with a designation
like:

```
module-NAME-STREAM-VERSION-CONTEXT

module-389-ds-1.4-8040020210810203142-866effaa
```

This is what pungi and other utilities bring in and then combine into a single
repo, generally, taking care of the module.yaml.

#### Default Modules

Most modules will have a set default that would be expected if a dnf install
was called. For example, in EL8 if you said `dnf install postgresql-server`,
the package that gets installed is version 10. If a module doesn't have a
default set, a `dnf install` will traditionally not work. To ensure a module
package will install without having to enable them and to use the default,
you need default information. Here's the postgresql example.

```
---
document: modulemd-defaults
version: 1
data:
  module: postgresql
  stream: 10
  profiles:
    9.6: [server]
    10: [server]
    12: [server]
    13: [server]
...
```

Even if a module only has one stream, default module information is still
needed to ensure that a package can be installed without enabling the module
explicitly. Here's an example.

```
---
document: modulemd-defaults
version: 1
data:
  module: httpd
  stream: 2.4
  profiles:
    2.4: [common]
...
```

This type of information is expected by pungi as a default modules repo that
can be configured. These YAML's are not with the modules themselves. They are
brought in when the repos are being created in the first place.

In the context of lazybuilder, it checks for defaults if enabled and then the
final repo that's made of the results will immediately have the information
at the top. See the references below for the jinja template that lazybuilder
uses to generate this information.

As a final note, let's say an update comes in for postgresql and you want to
ensure that the old version of postgresql 10 and the updated version of 10
can stay together. This is when the final module data is combined together
and then it's added into the repo using `modifyrepo_c`. Note though, you do
*not* have to have the modulemd-defaults provided again. You can have it once
such as the first time you made the repo in the first place, and it will still
work.

### Building the packages

So we have an idea of how the module data itself is made and managed. All there
is left to do is to do a chain build in mock. The kicker is you need to pay
attention to the build order that is assigned to each package being built. **If
a build order isn't assigned, assume that it's group 0 and will be built first.**
This does not stop 0 being assigned, but just know that `buildorder` being
omitted implies group 0. See below.

```
    components:
        rpms:
            first:
                rationale: core functions
                ref: 3.0
                buildorder: 0
            second:
                rationale: ui
                ref: latest
                buildorder: 0
            third:
                rationale: front end
                ref: latest
                buildorder: 1
```

What this shows is that the packages in build group 0 can be built simultaneously
in the context of Koji+MBS. For a local build, you'd just put them first in the
list. Basically each of these groups have to be done, completed, and available
right away for the next package or set of packages. For koji+mbs, they do this
automatically since they have a tag/repo that gets updated on each completion
and the builds are done in parallel.

For mock, a chain build will always have an internal repo that it uses, so each
completed package will have a final createrepo done on it before moving on to the
next package in the list. It's not parallel like koji, but it's still consistent.

Essentially a mock command would look like:

```
mock -r module.cfg \
  --chain \
  --localrepo /var/lib/mock/modulename \
  first.src.rpm \
  second.src.rpm \
  third.src.rpm
```

### Making the final YAML and repo

It's probably wise to have a template to make the module repo data off of. It's
the same as having a script to "transmodrify" the module data properly to be
used. Having a template will simplify a lot of things and will make it easier
to convert the data from git and then the final build artifacts and data that
makes the module data. The lazybuilder template is a good starting point,
though it is a bit ugly, being made in jinja. It can be made better using
python or even golang.

Regardless, you should have it templated or scripted somehow. See the references
in the next section.

### A note about virtual modules

Virtual modules are weird. They do not have a module dist tag, and they are just
built like... any other RPM. The difference here is that a virtual module while
it will should have an api['rpms'] list, it will **not** have an artifacts section.

A huge example of this is perl:5.26 in EL8. perl 5.26 is the default version. If
you install perl-interpreter, you'll get `perl-interpreter-5.26.3-419.el8_4.1.x86_64`.
Notice how it doesn't have a module tag? That's because it wasn't built directly
in MBS. There are not many virtual modules, but this is important to keep in mind
that these do in fact exist. The module yaml itself will *not* have a list of
packages to build, aka a "components" section. Here's the current EL8 perl 5.26 example.

## Reference

Below is a reference for what's in a module's data. Some keys are optional.
There'll also be an example from lazybuilder, which uses jinja to template out
the final data that is used in a repo.

### Module Template and Known Keys

Below are the keys that are expected in the YAML for both defaults and the
actual module build itself. Each item will have information on the type of
value it is (eg, is it a string, list), if it's optional or mandatory, plus
comments that may point out what's valid in source data rather than final
repo data. Some of the data below may not be used in EL, but it's important
to know what is possible and what could be expected.

This information was copied from: [Fedora Modularity](https://github.com/fedora-modularity/libmodulemd/tree/main/yaml_specs)

            # Overrides the above values for systems with this intent.
            # From the above, foo:x.y has "other" as the value and foo:bar has
            # no default profile.
            profiles:

            profiles:
                'x.y': []
```

**Note**: The glossary explains this, but remember that **AUTOMATIC** means that
it will typically not be in the module data itself, and will likely be in
repo data itself. There are also spots where thare are things that are **MANDATORY**
but also do not show up in a lot of modules, because the implicit/default option
turns off that section.

**Note**: There is a large chunk of these keys and values that state they are
**AUTOMATIC** and they do show up in the module data as a result of the module data
source and/or the build system doing work. An example of this is **arch**, among
others.
