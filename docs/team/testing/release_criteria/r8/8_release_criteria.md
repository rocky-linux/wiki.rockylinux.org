# {{ rc.prod }} {{ rc.ver }} {{ rc.level }} Release Objectives

The objective of a release (major or minor) is to provide a solid Enterprise Linux release that is suitable to:

- Meet the needs of end users
- Meet the needs of enterprises big or small

## {{ rc.prod }} {{ rc.ver }} {{ rc.level }} Release Requirements

In order for {{ rc.prod }} to be released to the general public, a compose must be able to meet all the following criteria as provided in this document. This is allows the decision process to be straightforward and as clear as possible. This document only contains “hard requirement” items. Optional/nice to have items are not to be included in this list.

There may cases where a requirement cannot be met but only in particular configurations. In these types of cases, the Release Engineering Team should use their judgement to determine whether or not the issue should be considered to block the release. They should consider the number of users likely to be affected by said issue, the severity of the case, if the issue can be avoided with ease (by both informed and uninformed users), and if the problem exists upstream in the current Red Hat Enterprise Linux that the release is based on.

!!! info "Release-blocking Server"
    ...means bugs as it pertains to server functionality can be considered to block a release. This applies to any packages that provide a service such as httpd, nginx, etc. All architectures apply.

!!! info "Release-blocking Desktop"
    ...means bugs as it pertains to desktop functionality (GNOME) can be considered to block a release. This applies to both x86_64 and aarch64. Additional desktops (as provided by EPEL or a SIG) are not considered blockers.

!!! info "Release-blocking Image"
    ...means bugs as it pertains to the images built that can block a release. This applies to the DVD, minimal, and boot images on all architectures.

### Initialization Requirements

#### Release-blocking images must boot

Release-blocking installer images must boot when written to optical media or USB flash drive of appropriate sizes (if applicable) via officially supported methods. It is not the testing team’s responsibility to test optical media, but they can and report back. If a bug is found, it is considered a blocker.

??? tldr "Optical Media Requirements"
    Release-blocking images must boot when written to optical media of an appropriate size. Current size requirements are: boot.iso = 789M, minimal.iso = 2.0G and dvd.iso = 10G.

??? tldr "Officially supported USB flash drive writing methods"
    The following methods of writing USB flash drives are officially support: dd<br>
    The following methods of writing USB flash drives are _**not**_ supported: rufus

        - [QA:Testcase Boot Methods Boot ISO](Testcase_Boot_Methods_Boot_Iso.md)
        - [QA:Testcase Boot Methods DVD](Testcase_Boot_Methods_Dvd.md)
        - [QA:Testcase Media USB dd](Testcase_Media_USB_dd.md)

#### Basic Graphics Mode behaviors
The generic video driver option (“basic graphics mode”) on all release-blocking installers must function as intended. This means launching the installer or desktop and attempting to use a generic driver. There must be no bugs that prevent the installer from being reached in this configuration on all systems and classes of hardware supported by the enterprise linux kernel.

    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase Basic Graphics Mode](Testcase_Basic_Graphics_Mode.md)

#### No Broken Packages
Critical errors, such as undeclared conflicts, unresolved dependencies, or modules relying on packages from another stream will be considered an automatic blocker. There are potential exceptions to this (eg, freeradius cannot be installed on an older perl stream, this is a known issue upstream).

        - [QA:Testcase Media Repoclosure](Testcase_Media_Repoclosure.md)
        - [QA:Testcase Media File Conflicts](Testcase_Media_File_Conflicts.md)

#### Repositories Must Match Upstream
Repositories and the packages within them should match upstream as closely as possible. Notable exceptions would be kmods, kpatch, or what is deemed as “spyware” like insights. Packages that are available from upstream should not have hard requirements on RHSM and packages that have it default built in should be patched out.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase Repo Compare](Testcase_Repo_Compare.md)
        - [QA:Testcase Packages No Insights](Testcase_Packages_No_Insights.md)
        - [QA:Testcase Packages No RHSM](Testcase_Packages_No_RHSM.md)

#### Debranding
Assets and functionality that are Red Hat specific should not be included. If they are not patched out, it will be considered an automatic blocker.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase Debranding](Testcase_Debranding.md)

### Installer Requirements

#### Media Consistency Verification
This means that the installer’s mechanism for verifying the install medium is intact and must complete successfully, with the assumption that the medium was correctly written. It should return a failure message if this not the case.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Packages and Installer Sources
The installer must be able to use all supported local/remote packages and installer sources.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### NAS (Network Attached Storage)"
The installer must be able to detect and install to supported NAS devices (if possible and supported by the kernel).
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Installation Interfaces
The installer must be able to complete an installation using all supported spokes.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Minimal Installation
A minimal installation (via network) must be able to install the minimal package set.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Disk Layouts
The installer must be able to create and install to any workable partition layout using any file system or format combination offered or supported by the installer. File systems that are not supported by the EL kernel is not tested here (this means btrfs, zfs, both of wish are not supported).
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Firmware RAID
The installer must be able to detect and install to firmware RAID devices. Note that system-specific bugs do not count as blockers. It is likely that some hardware support might be broken or not available at all. DUDs (driver update disks) are not considered for this criteria.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Bootloader Disk Selection
The installer must allow the user to choose which disk the bootloader will be installed to or, if the user so chooses, not to install a bootloader.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Storage Volume Resize
Any installer mechanism for resizing storage volumes must correctly attempt the requested operation. This means that if the installer offers a way to resize storage volumes, then it must use the correct resizing tool with the correct parameters. However, it does not require the installer to disallow resizing of unformatted or volumes with an unknown filesystem type.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Update Image
The installer must be able to use an installer update image retrieved from removable media or a remote package source. This includes DUDs (driver update disks).
??? tldr "References"

#### Installer Help
Any element in the installer which contains a “help” text must display the appropriate help documentation when selected.
??? tldr "References"
    - Test cases:
        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

#### Installer Translations
The installer must correctly display all complete translations that are available for use.
??? tldr "References"

        - [QA:Testcase TBD](Testcase_Template.md)

### Cloud Image Requirements
#### Images Published to Cloud Providers
