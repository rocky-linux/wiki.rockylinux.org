## Overview:

Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean’s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October.\

Rockylinux has been involved by hosting a simple open-source project for anyone to contribute!\




## Highlights

  1. Johnny Santamaria made a post on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnnyds_i-got-the-hacktoberfest-2024-registered-activity-7250296534712385536-t9u9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about this event

  2. Tools used: Github and Markdown

  3. I learned how to add files to contribute to projects

  4. I can apply this learning to team projects so everyone is on the same page




Workflow to contribute

  1. Check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/hacktoberfest)

     Note that there are still open source projects to look at after October which you can do for fun

  3. Look at the project-sharing channel

  4. Open a repo

  5. Open issue on repo

  6. Star repo

  7. Fork repo

  8. Clone repo

  9. Read on the issue







## Outcome

I think this is a wonderful event to get people into open-source, no matter what skill set they have.

I believe this is important since they promote innovation, accessibility, and community involvement, making open-source projects a critical part of the modern software ecosystem.

It is also an easy way to make an impact digitally!
